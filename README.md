INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C.
      - Open a new workspace and create two files:
            1. main.c (C source code file)
            2. small-list.csv (file with students)

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the commond prompt "gcc FILENAME.c" to compile and "./a.out" to run
      - Once compiled, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
